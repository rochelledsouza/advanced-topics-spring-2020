# The Life and Death of Senator Robert F. Kennedy

<!-- Just a few simple things here please.  -->
The assasination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 was a monumental event which altered the direction of the United States of America. As recounted by Juan Romero, an eyewitness to the assasination, Robert Kennedy’s death occurred immediately after his speech celebrating his win as the Democratic primary presidential candidate. The Senator’s death occurred a few months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and contributed to the ongoing division in the country. In the midst of the Vietnam War, Senator Kennedy strongly supported the US’ withdrawal from the war zone and was a prominent Civil Rights supporter.
