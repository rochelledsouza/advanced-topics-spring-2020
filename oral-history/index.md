  <em>Juan Romero holding the dying Senator Robert F. Kennedy (Photograph by <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.proquest.com%2Fdocview%2F277955109%3Faccountid%3D14771">Bill Eppridge</a>)</em>

&emsp;Juan Romero, was an employee at the Ambassador Hotel in California. He met the presidential candidate the night before the assassination and received much media and public attention for the photograph displaying him holding the dying Senator in his arms. Romero, 17 years old at the time, was an immigrant from Mexico and worked as a busboy at the Ambassador Hotel while also studying at Roosevelt High School <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.proquest.com%2Fdocview%2F406196548%3Faccountid%3D14771">(Epic Vision: Forty Years Ago Tomorrow)</a>. The photograph that captured Romero’s reaction to Kennedy’s shooting was taken by Bill Eppridge who had followed the Senator around his campaign trail <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.proquest.com%2Fdocview%2F277955109%3Faccountid%3D14771">(Vivid Images of RFK's Death)</a>. Kennedy, along with his pregnant wife, Ethel were celebrating his candidacy for the presidential race when he visited the kitchens of the Ambassador Hotel, greeting the hotel staff as he passed. It was as he was shaking hands with Romero, that the shooting began  <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.proquest.com%2Fdocview%2F406196548%3Faccountid%3D14771">(Epic Vision: Forty Years Ago Tomorrow)</a>. Police apprehended Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian who was apparently angered by Kennedy’s support of Israel <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bobby-kennedy-is-assassinated">(History: 1968 June 05, Robert Kennedy is fatally shot)</a>. Sirhan received a death sentence which was later commuted to life in prison <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/05/26/who-killed-bobby-kennedy-his-son-rfk-jr-doesnt-believe-it-was-sirhan-sirhan/">(Washington Post)</a>. There have been many key figures, including Paul Schrade who was shot by Sirhan, as well as Robert F. Kennedy’s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who have publicly called for a re-investigation as they were unconvinced that Sirhan was the sole assailant <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/05/26/who-killed-bobby-kennedy-his-son-rfk-jr-doesnt-believe-it-was-sirhan-sirhan/">(Washington Post)</a>.</br>
&emsp;The younger brother of President John F. Kennedy, who was also assassinated, albeit in 1963,  Robert F. Kennedy, was an experienced political worker who assisted his brother’s presidential campaign and served as the US Attorney General <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy">(John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)</a>. He served in the US Navy, received a law degree and served as a close advisor to President Kennedy <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy">(John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)</a>. The future Senator was instrumental in the Cuban Missile Crisis, helping the President’s council develop a very successful non-engagement negotiation response to the crisis <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy">(John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)</a>. Prior to his assassination, Senator Kennedy’s primary focus on his campaign trail was ending the Vietnam War. He criticised President Lyndon B. Johnson for a prolonged interference in Southeast Asia and was determined to end military support in the region once elected as President <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.proquest.com%2Fdocview%2F277955109%3Faccountid%3D14771">(Vivid Images of RFK's Death)</a>. He was also well known for being a major supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and was famous for supporting the integration of all American schools and enfranchising African-Americans <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy">(John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)</a>. According to the JFK Presidential Library and Museum, Senator Kennedy in his appointment as Attorney General had enforced the integration of school by sending US troops to protect the first African-American student of the University of Mississippi <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy">(John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)</a>. Furthermore, under the Kennedy Administration, he had assisted President Kennedy <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy">(John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)</a> with the drafting of the <a href ="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-act">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, which came into effect after the President’s assassination. This legislation ended segregation and was further expanded to enfranchise all Americans <a href ="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-act">(Civil Rights Act of 1964)</a>. His assassination compounded tragedy of the Martin Luther King’s death in April 1968 which had led to many protests across the country. Kennedy’s support of the Civil Rights Movement and the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam, made him an extremely popular candidate in fractured America.</br> 
&emsp;As explained by Romero, Senator Kennedy’s assassination greatly affected a turbulent United States. The letters sent to Romero reveal the deep-seated anger the American public felt about the sudden and unexpected death of a widely popular Democratic presidential candidate. Unfortunately, this anger was directed towards a young high school boy whose guilt and trauma because of the assassination lasted long after the Sirhan trials. His visit to Kennedy’s grave was document by the Los Angeles Times, which recounted his evident grief decades after the assassination <a href = "https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0830-lopez-romero-20150829-column.html">(LA Times)</a>. The Ambassador Hotel where the assassination occurred, was demolished in 2006 which led to debate between many archivists and preservationists about the preservation of the kitchen where Kennedy was shot. The debate between historians centered upon whether the focus should be drawn towards Senator Kennedy’s legacy or his assassination <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.proquest.com%2Fdocview%2F422040014%3Faccountid%3D14771">(A Pantry's Painful Artifacts)</a>. With the Kennedy family against the preservation of the site, a Commission to evaluate the historical importance of the kitchen was created. The Commission declared that the kitchen had minimal historical impact as the hotel had been demolished and a school would be built in its place.</br>
&emsp;Ultimately, Robert F. Kennedy’s assassination is often overshadowed by President John F. Kennedy’s assasination as well as Martin Luther King’s assassination. However, much in the same way that the latter two men are remembered for their great legacies, so too is Senator Kennedy remembered for his legacy. His work towards ending segregation in America, his strategies which stemmed the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as his dedication to the Civil Rights Movement, helped many people, including Romero, “[feel] important, [feel] American and [feel] good" <a href ="https://storycorps.org/stories/an-eyewitness-details-the-assassination-of-robert-f-kennedy/">(Story Corps: An Eyewitness Details the Assassination of Robert F.

<!-- Add your content here, including _markup_ of **various kinds**. Now you can just write! But you should be aware of a couple of advanced features of markdown:
- you can embed HTML directly n a markdown file. This is great if you want to add complex attributes like **classes**, e.g. to your `img` tags so that they display properly (though you can also use the `{.css-selector}` method ddescribed in the main readme.
  - a particular use of embedded HTML is for funky javascript function links. I've written a simple function that will seek to a particular time code in seconds.  You can call it like this: `<a href="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>`, but `[seek to 1:15](javascript:seek(75))` won't render properly, so you have to type the whole link in, as seen here: <a href="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.
  - also, markdown-it supports pandoc-style footnotes, which can be helpful sometimes. Here are some examples of footnotes at work:

    Footnote 1 link[^first].

    Footnote 2 link[^second].

    Inline footnote^[Text of inline footnote] definition.

    Duplicated footnote reference[^second].


[^first]: Footnote **can have markup**

    and multiple paragraphs.

[^second]: Footnote text.
