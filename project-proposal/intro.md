### Project Proposal

**Introduction**</br>
#
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project aims to understand the rise of populist rulers in the 21st century, juxtaposing the conditions for their rise to power against authoritarian rulers such as Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Hugo Chavez and Joseph Stalin. Over the past decade, there has been a significant rise in populism and demagogues rising to power. Populism has often been viewed as a danger to political systems like democracies, as they threaten de-stabilisation and the rise of authoritarianism, if populist leaders gather too much power. Political leaders such as United States President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro are all examples of world leaders who have utilised populist language in order to facilitate their rise to power. While this project examines current political systems, its foundation draws upon crucial historical events such as examining the rise of Nazism, Facisim and Communism in the 20th century. By using a historical lens to analyse current world affairs, this project attempts to perceive if history does indeed repeat itself. The project aims to research the social, economic, political and cultural conditions in countries like Italy, Germany, Venezuela and Russia, prior to the collapse of the previous political system and capturing the rise of authoritarian regimes. Using a digital history framework to collate the acquired research, this project will then utilise data from real world surveys through social media, political polls from election years as well as news articles. The accumulated data will then be used to compare and contrast the socio-political and cultural landscapes in the US, Britain, India and Brazil, against the rise of Mussolini, Hitler, Chavez and Stalin.</br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research project will draw upon a wealth of existing historical research and primary accounts to understand the social climates in those regions prior to the rise of authoritarian regimes. Compiling the conditions that gave power to these authoritarian leaders, will be useful in broadening the understanding of historians and political scientists of the stability of current political systems. The data could be used to extrapolate whether the countries like the US, the UK, India and Brazil are facing political crises and if there is an imminent, potential destabilization in world power. The historical research in this project is especially important for an understanding of the current political climate across the world as it will reveal a predictive or explanatory element to history which deepens the comprehension of the current political order. In using a digital platform to present the historical lens examining the rise of populism in both the 20th and 21st centuries, this project will increase its accessibility and availability to the general global public. In addition, students of history will also benefit from the application of a historical and digital lens to the world’s political landscape, as these different perspectives will broaden their insight. The vast scope of this project will require a least a few years of research and a dedicated small team of researchers which is why this research proposal requests the funding of the **Large Grant**.
