# Africville: The History of Racism in Nova Scotia 

<!-- Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, before the map and buttons. To change the colors, modify the defaults in [style.css](../css/map-styles.css). -->

The destruction of Africville, once located near Halifax in Nova Scotia, reveals the Canadian racism against Black Canadians in the late 1900’s. In the mid 18th century, there was an influx of enslaved African people who were brought over to build Halifax’s infrastructure<a href = https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville> (Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia)</a>. Africville was located near the Bedford Basin, connected to Halifax by Campbell Road, <a href = https://novascotia.ca/archives/explosion/results.asp?Search=&SearchList1=all>now renamed Barrington Road</a>. The suburb was founded as an housing area for the enslaved people but by the 1830’s, Africville was occupied by many Black Americans who had escaped to Canada after the War of 1812 <a href = https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville> (Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia)</a>. The name ‘Africville’ appears to be derived from the term ‘African Village’<a href = https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville> (Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia)</a>, which was used by Haligonians to represent the predominantly Black neighborhood. In 1848, William Arnold and William Brown became the first Black men to own land in Africville<a href= https://africvillemuseum.org/the-community-of-africville/>(Africville Museum)</a>. As documented by the Africville Museum, most members of the community owned land in Africville by the 1900’s. However, in the 1970’s, the residents of Africville were driven out of the town by the government who had decided to rehabilitate the neighborhood, with many criticising the poor living standards of the residents<a href = https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville> (Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia)</a>. Utilising human rights rhetoric, the Canadian government erased the community of Africville, paying only those with proof of ownership for their land<a href =https://humanrights.ca/story/the-story-of-africville>(McRae, Canadian Museum for Human Rights)</a>. For those residents with no land deeds, the government paid them a small sum and forced them into relocating to other parts of Nova Scotia.
