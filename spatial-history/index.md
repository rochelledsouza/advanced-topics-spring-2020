Africville was considered to be one of the poorest areas near Halifax. Its residents faced much opposition and racism from Haligonians. They were relegated to the domestic service jobs in Halifax and were therefore often stigmatized further ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). The disregard of Africville is evident in the 1854 construction of the Canadian National Railway, whose railway lines cut through the community. Houses were destroyed and some residents were not compensated for their losses by the government. Furthermore, railway construction continued in the early 1900’s, despite the protests of the community about the health impacts and noise pollution caused by such close proximity to the railway lines ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). The residents of Africville were required to pay taxes, however due to a system of racist policies, Africville never benefited from public funds. The community founded their own post office, the Seaview United Baptist Church and a segregated school, despite the lack of government support. Lack of government funds meant that there were no paved roads, proper waste disposal or even running water in Africville ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). Instead the government invested funds into building the Rockford prison, an infectious disease hospital and later, an industrial dump, near the community. Haligonians protested having buildings like a prison and an infectious disease hospital in Halifax which was why the government built them near Africville instead. Furthermore, the property surrounding Africville was city owned, with many industrial buildings situated nearby which were serviced by the railway lines.<br/> 
By the early 1900’s the government was considering further conversion of Africville into an industrial town.
By the late 1940’s Africville was considered a slum by the government as well as other Nova Scotians ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). Due to the influx of factories in the area, there was a greater need to dispose of industrial waste in the area which led to the city’s decision to place an open pit dump near Africville. This dump furthered the public’s perception of Africville as a slum, with poor living conditions. In 1953, the segregated school was shut down in Africville as a result of Nova Scotia’s desegregation laws ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). Black students began travelling to Halifax for their education, where they were met with racism and opposition ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). In 1964, the city formally made plans to relocate the community’s residents, despite the opposition from the community. Disregarding that their own policies had resulted in Africville's poor development, the government promoted the industrialisation of Africville in order to provide the residents with better living conditions. Public perception of Africville as a slum meant that the community’s residents received little support from Haligonians. Furthermore, the residents were not consulted by the city planners and many were shocked to discover their homes were destroyed when the city implemented its plans ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). The Seaview United Baptist Church, along with hundreds of homes, were razed to the ground. The residents were forced to relocate to areas chosen by the government, and where many of them faced racism and threats. The destruction of Africville was a surprise to many of the community, so much so that most had little time to prepare. The city provided dump trucks to relocate Africville residents and their possessions to their new homes, with many community members not knowing where they were being relocated ([Tattrie, Canadian Encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/africville)). <br/> 
The destruction of Africville erased over a century’s worth of Black Canadian history in Nova Scotia. Racist policies hindered the community’s development, through the lack of provision of basic resources like running water, street lamps and sewage disposal, to the tax-paying Africville community. The razing of Africville occurred without consultation of the community and in the guise of bettering living conditions. From its birth, Africville was hindered by the racism it faced from the government and other Nova Scotians. The construction of railway lines in the midst of the town, along with an open pit dump, a prison and an infectious diseases hospital nearby, reveal the racism the community faced; especially since the construction of these had been protested when they were going to be built in and around Halifax. While the government recognised Africville as a Historic Site, it was only in 2010 that the government apologised for the destruction of Africville and monetarily supported the construction of the Seaview Church, which currently serves as the Africville Museum.
